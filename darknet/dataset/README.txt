The dataset is not stored in the repository or in the image, so you'll have to generate it.

To generate it use the `ek_dataset_studio` package in the ROS repository

```
# roslaunch ek_dataset_studio dataset_studio.launch
```

The package will generate images and store them in a dataset folder within the same package.
